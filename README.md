# RSS and LQI measuraments

This is a repository of Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) measurements collected in the Wireless Sensor Network of the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padua. These measurements could be used for indoor localization algorithms evaluations and radio communications experiments.

## Single channel

Sets of experimental RSSI measurements collected with Tmote-Sky wireless sensors in different environments. You can download all such data through the links belows, together with the specifics of the experimental settings and a short description of the platforms.

 * [Data set 1](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20101109/20101109_Automatica_Fixed_Sensor_Campaign_PUBLIC.zip) and its [readme](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20101109/README_20101109.txt) file
 * [Data set 2](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110201/20110201_Automatica_Mobile_Sensor_Campaign_PUBLIC.zip) and its [readme](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110201/README_20110201.txt) file

## Multiple channels

Set of experimental RSSI measurements collected with Tmote-Sky acquired in 16 different channel (frequencies) in different environments. You can [download](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110414/20110414_Automatica_Fixed_Sensor_Campaign_16_Channels_PUBLIC.zip) all such data [here](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110414/20110414_Automatica_Fixed_Sensor_Campaign_16_Channels_PUBLIC.zip), together with the [specifics](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110414/README_20110414.txt) of the experimental settings and a short [description](https://github.com/r4m/rssi-data/blob/master/20110414/README_20110414.txt) of the platforms.
